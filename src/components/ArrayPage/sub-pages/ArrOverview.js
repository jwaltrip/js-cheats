          An array is an ordered collection of data (either primitive or object
          depending upon the language). Arrays are used to store multiple values
          in a single variable. This is compared to a variable that can store
          only one value. Each item in an array has a number attached to it,
          called a numeric index, that allows you to access it. In JavaScript,
          arrays start at index zero and can be manipulated with various
          methods. What an array in JavaScript looks like:{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="ex1">
          <ul>
            <li>var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];</li>
            <li>
              var catNamesArray = ["Jacqueline", "Sophia", "Autumn"];
            </li>{" "}
            <li>{`//Arrays in JavaScript can hold different types of data, as shown
              above.`}</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
